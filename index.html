                <p>PromenadePDX is an opportunity to pull out you fanciest attire and celebrate, dance and eat with
                    Portland’s greatest (and fanciest)
                    Individuals. </p>

                <h2>What do I wear?</h2>
                <p>PromenadePDX is all about self expression. We recommend not wearing anything that would fit more into
                    the
                    categories of costume and
                    cosplay as we want to see your own unique style and your own personal definition of fancy
                    Fashion.</p>
